# Next Steps After Generating Codes
After the SDK is generated and the ApiView is approved by Arch Board, you still need to do some manual changes in the generated codes, such as adding samples/tests.

For different language of sdk, there will be different next steps, and you can find them in the following table:

| SDK    | Next Steps Link |
|--------|-----------------|
| .Net   |                 |
| Java   |                 |
| Python |                 |
| JS     |                 |
