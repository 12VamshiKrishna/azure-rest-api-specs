# Next Steps After Generating Codes
After the SDK is generated and the ApiView is approved by Arch Board, you still need to do some manual changes in the generated codes, such as adding samples/tests.

You can find there are SDK PRs generated in swagger PR comment `Swagger Generation Artifacts -> azure-sdk-for-<language> -> Preview SDK Changes`. After finding the SDK PR, you can get the generated codes from the source branch of SDK PR.

For different language of sdk, there will be different next steps, and you can find them in the following table:

| SDK    | Next Steps Link |
|--------|-----------------|
| .Net   |                 |
| Java   |                 |
| Python |                 |
| JS     |                 |

After completing code changes, you can create a new branch for the codes and create a PR in SDK repository to merge the final codes.
